WP Mail SMTP
---

https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/

**Modified to store SMTP passwords encrypted in the WP db by a password stored in wp-config.php.**

Modifications by Neil McGann.

Uses openssl encryption and decryption. Note that if the key in wp-config.php is compromised then the passwords can be decrypted easily.

Key can be one of the 64 character salts generated by https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/.

**Stored in wp-config.php as:**

define('WPMS_SMTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY', 'key here');

The password field in the plugin settings page will show up as a password type with obscured characters only if
there is a valid encryption key and if encryption is enabled (set the key first and then activate the plugin to enable).

If the saved password cannot be decrypted a message saying "***DECRYPT ERROR***" will be shown in the password box. Just save the password
again to over-write the faulty one.
